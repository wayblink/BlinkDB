Today, An interesting idea come into my mind.------ Why not develop my own database?

I will be exciting to learn with a goal, though it seems very big.

I set up this repositry to record the process I will make. Hope it will survive long. Haha~

Before the real work, I need to learn something about different kinds of databases and then figure out what I wanna build.

It is a mess! 
Let's make it simple first.
What kind of database I would like to see and possible to develop by a single man?
